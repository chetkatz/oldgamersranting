      <description>Episode 0102
This is episode 0102 of the Old Gamers Ranting podcast: 
We talk about our biggest gaming-related disappointments and hint at segueing into a related topic. We also establish that B-Diddy thought that using a &amp;ldquo;funny&amp;rdquo; name to make fun of someone else&amp;rsquo;s name would be cool. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t. (At least he didn&amp;rsquo;t sound like a robut.)
Within these recordings are preserved the collective wisdom of the Old Gamers Ranting, shared with you through the magicks of the digital interwebnetubes so that you may learn and understand their highly enlightened opinions on video games, automobiles, parenting, current events and a veritable cornucopia of other topics, shared with you in their own words and with their own voices.</description>

      <description>“These dang whippersnappers keep running across my lawn!” Imagine an old geezer standing on his front porch, waving his walking cane and yelling at the neighborhood kids. Now you have an image in your mind of exactly who we are. Or who at least one of us is. Wait&amp;hellip; maybe it&amp;rsquo;s best to apply that image to us as a whole instead of individually, and think about it that way.</description>
